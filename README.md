# TheVirtualWorld
This is for IT511 final project

This project is a Java project for my course IT511. I am very new to writing code at this point. I hope to improve this applicaiton and create better ones in the future.

This project's prompt:
In creating your virtual world, you will need to create a MyClone class that will represent a virtual clone, another class that will represent a ShoutBox, and another class of your choice. The class of your choice can be anything you want to exist in your virtual world (a cat, a bird, a computer, etc.). This project is a prototype and there will not be any graphics, so you will create an application that unit tests the functionality of your three classes (your MyClone class, your ShoutBox class, and the class of your choice).
